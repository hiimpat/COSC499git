COSC499git

The initial master branch will just have an unsorted array and a readme file

The first feature branch is called sort. In this branch, an unsorted array is printed out and then that array is sorted
and then printed out again. There is another array that is already sorted and is compared to our original array, if they
are the same then it prints out the the array is sorted.

The second feature branch is called min max. In this branch, the program finds the minimum and maximum values in the
array and prints them out. There are correct answers saved at the top along with the arrays and is compared to the values
that we got. If they are the same then it will say that the values are correct.
