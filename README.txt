COSC499git

The initial master branch will just have an unsorted array and a readme file

The first feature branch is called sort. In this branch, an unsorted array is printed out and then that array is sorted
and then printed out again. There is another array that is already sorted and is compared to our original array, if they
are the same then it prints out the the array is sorted.
